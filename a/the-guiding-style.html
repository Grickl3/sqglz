				</div><!-- BLOCK HEADER -->

				<div id="seek-to-serve-body" class="about__body-block__body">
					<p class="about__body-block__copy">Yes, The Guiding Style is a pilot program, meaning I just recently created it. However, I created it out of the processes that were working best from all the client work I’ve been doing over the last decade. So, the methods involved are those which I’ve seen get clients results every time. Only the packaging and degree of focus are new.</p>

					<span class="about__body-block__title">How do I choose between The Guiding Style and other branding services?</span>
				</div><!-- BLOCK HEADER -->

				<div id="seek-to-serve-body" class="about__body-block__body">
					<h2>Is your organization mission-driven?</h2>
					<p class="about__body-block__copy">Business-as-usual dictates that the point of doing business is to drive as much profit to the owner of the business as possible. That assumption might hold for most businesses. <em> I actually kinda think that it’s fewer business than some folks think </em>. So, most business branding processes are designed around value exchange — <em>the source of profit</em>, instead of shared values — <em>the root of community</em>. SQGLZ clients have more interesting goals. For us, profit is just another tool. Businesses need it, but it is never the point. This central difference is so fundamental to our outlook that it is saturated into every aspect of our design process. So, if profit is the highest aim of your venture, you will find a lot of good options for brand development firms — but SQGLZ probably isn’t for you.</p>

					<h2>Are you a small to medium sized business ( 35 people or fewer )?</h2>
					<p>Big business gets a bad rap, mostly because of the behavior of big businesses. I’m not one to think that all large businesses are horribly corrupt, though. I actually have a few favorites myself: Chrome ( <em>my favorite for bags and boots</em> ), National Geographic ( <em>pre buy-out</em> ), and Guinness have all shown themselves to be pretty solid corporate citizens of the world. That said, companies at these scales have to operate with layers of hierarchy — or at least a lot of somewhat separate divisions. The Guiding Style is simply not built out for that many stakeholders and concerns to be adequately integrated into the process.</p>

					<h2>Are you entering a growth phase which will require materials production within the next eighteen months?</h2>
					<p>If you’re trying to determine what the best timing for doing a program like this is, the answer is simple: Ideally, you’ll start The Guiding Style three months or more before you invest in substantial growth assets for your business. So, if you’re thinking about redeveloping your website, launching a course, creating an email marketing automation, launching a new product line, or anything else that requires a substantial investment in the design and creation of customer facing assets, and you want those assets to be out in the world within the next eighteen months, then this is the time.</p>

					<h2>So &#8230;</h2>
					<p>If you’ve answered ‘yes’ to all of those, then it’ll be well worth your time to mash that button below and apply to The Guiding Style. Once you complete the application, I’ll be in touch. If either of us sees that the Guiding Style is not right for you, I’ll offer my best thinking on what would be a good next step with your branding and marketing.</p>

					<p class="about__body-block__copy">Most importantly, you’ll have clarity and direction about the image you’re presenting and how to consistently present it. You’ll know exactly what to do to exponentially build recognition with the people who share and support your vision. Also of critical importance, you’ll know what not to do to disrupt that upward spiral.</p>
					<p class="about__body-block__copy">More concretely, you’ll have a comprehensive package of design assets developed to support your mission and message. This includes:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>logo variants for all mediums and scales</li>
						<li>color and type systems, not just a set of colors but a specific methodology for putting them to use effectively</li>
						<li>patterns, textures, and icons that support the feeling your brand means to convey</li>
						<li>tools and specifications for shooting photos and selecting imagery, as well as processing that imagery for consistency in appearance</li>
						<li>a thoroughly organized guide with examples, processes, and systems for how your brand communicates your vision and value to the world</li>

				<div id="seek-to-serve-body" class="about__body-block__body">
					<p class="about__body-block__copy">It will cost you 4–7 minutes to fill out the application; that’s the whole risk on the table right now. If you’re planning growth investments in the next eighteen months, then The Guiding Style is going to save you money. And, if you aren’t well positioned to grow in the next eighteen months, then I’m not going to let you into the program. No one benefits if this doesn’t help you solve your problems.</p>
					<p class="about__body-block__copy">The simple truth that I’ve found is that when a business owner starts thinking of an investment ( <em>something you want to have the best version of</em> ) as an expense ( <em>something you want to spend as little on as you can</em> ) they start thinking of the brand development process in all the wrong ways. Let’s figure out if The Guiding Style will improve your business. Then, we’ll sort out how to cover the tab.</p>
					<p class="about__body-block__copy">Also, considering that this is the pilot, the exact price for the program is going to change, and it probably won’t be going down. Let’s start a conversation now about what’s best for your business and find the best fit and timing according to your current position and goals.</p>

				<div id="seek-to-serve-body" class="about__body-block__body">
					<p class="about__body-block__copy">I believe that most businesses will spend about ninety days in the pilot program. After a number of businesses have completed the pilot, I may actually set a specific time frame. For right now, just know that you’ll have all the time you need and that the program was designed with entrepreneurs in mind. Depending on your focus, timing, and availability, we may move through it all more or less quickly.</p>

				</div><!-- BLOCK HEADER -->

				<div id="seek-to-serve-body" class="about__body-block__body">
					<p class="about__body-block__copy">The Guiding Style is for mission-driven businesses, emphasis on the ‘mission-driven’. All kinds of organization can be suitable to participate. For non-profits, we’ll have a talk about exactly how your revenue model works before you enter the program. For co-op businesses, the only concern is how many cooks will be in the kitchen. And, for community groups, it just depends on what your goals are, why growth matters, and whether a not the organizations relationship to its members fits the model used in the Guiding style.</p>
					<p class="about__body-block__copy">Here’s the key, if your organization is trying to make the world saner, help communities become more autonomous, strengthening families, and empower individuals, I’d love to talk. If SQGLZ can’t help you, odds are good that we can help you with a beneficial connection or two.<p>
