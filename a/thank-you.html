			<p>I’ve been given many gifts in my life. That doo-dad at the bottom of my necklace is older than calculus. It was a gift from an old scholar as a blessing on my path as a martial artist. When I opened Fortify, a friend and former student paid for the flooring. My teachers contributed equipment. The outpouring of support has been a consistent goad to keep moving, to stay on the path. I have a beautiful solid brass pen that a kind gentleman once handed to me and said, “I have a feeling that you would appreciate this.” I do. And, these physical gifts are only one side of it. I have received thousands of hours of individual attention from sagasic minds accomplished in martial arts, politics, chess and go, Kabbalism, and business. There’s an old man who used to play chess with Bobby Fishcer and Kasparov, yet he takes the time to play with me. I don’t know that anyone can deserve the kind of fortune that I’ve experienced, but I try to live up to it. I strive to merit the gifts I am given. And, God willing, I’ll live long enough to pay back one-tenth of one-thousandth — as the Shinto say. That is the best we can hope to do.</p>

			<p>By far, the most valuable things which I’ve ever been given are opportunities. I am surrounded by people eager to help me with all sorts of wild ideas, based merely on the shared understanding that, together, we have a shot at shaping a better world. Sometimes that faith comes in the form of hours and hours clicking out code. Sometimes it comes as two dollars a month. In all cases, I see it as faith. And, I really don’t want to let you all down.</p>

			<h1>You have my thanks and my camaraderie.</h1>

			<h3>Ryan C.</h3>
			<p>Starting the individual shoutouts with Ryan is a bit of a no-brainer to me. When I look around my physical surroundings, he’s simply given me so many actual gifts. The man is a prolific sculptor, so it may seem only natural. He lives and thrives in artifacts of practicality and expression. There is, though, a peculiar brilliance to Ryan’s gifts. He somehow manages to consistently find or craft gifts which are both an enhancement to the day-to-day life of the recipient and an expression of himself. It’s a neat trick. I really enjoy the ever present reminders of my distant friend.</p>

			<div class="space--small"></div>

			<h3>Betsy L.</h3>
			<p>An impressive and stunning trait which I’ve found in very few people is the capacity to give generously and creatively like clockwork. Betsy is possessed of this virtue. A birthday comes around; Betsy shows up. And, she doesn’t just have a gift. She has a one of a kind gift: an antique book on a subject of particular interest by a favorite author, or an imported tea only available in one shop at the far end of town. It is impossible to not feel the dedication and the value of caring, familial tradition.</p>

			<div class="space--small"></div>

			<h3>Marty H.</h3>
			<p>Objects which Marty gave me include a weighted jump rope, a copy of The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, and a Doors album on cassette. He also left me one of the most important examples that a person can model, how to die incredibly well. Having grown up in dojos, I’ve heard — and repeated — a lot of talk about the importance of daily contemplation of the end of one’s own life. The representation in that environment frequently implies that one should rehearse the end of one’s life in order to be at peace in battle. In a way, this is true. But, Marty demonstrated a higher interpretation. We keep the fact of our end in front of us in order to make the best possible decisions in all of the little battles. When we live in such a way that the effects which follow our influence in the world are an evergreen harvest, we can slip away in peace. We can know that we have left good will, reputation, and an example for those we leave behind.</p>

			<h3>Shawn H.</h3>
			<p>When the conflict at Standing Rock, concerning the Keystone XL Pipeline was escalating, I truly wanted to be there. Early 2000s Deacon probably would have been there, or working somewhere in the supply line. At the time, I had otherwise committed myself, but was watching the news of the event and getting occasional updates on happenings. I was equal parts inspired by activists from all parts enduring a Dakota winter to fight a losing battle, and heartbroken by the familiarity of the futile strategies employed.</p>

			<p>When Shawn returned from his time there, I was very eager to sit down with him and discuss the whole affair. Only a few times in my life have I had the experience of moving quickly or immediately to communication about the spiritual essence of a thing. It was so clear to me that Shawn had witnessed not only the heart of the whole affair, but had seen into the souls of so many of the people involved. He was able to recount both tactical and emotional events, to relate the sequences and their causes. Those hours we spent discussing the encampment were more than informative; they were illuminating. Jim Rohn once said that he had a friend who was so skilled at being present that it was better to give him your vacation money and send him away to enjoy exotic locations. The way he could talk about them when he got back was better than going yourself. Well, Standing Rock is no vacation spot, but Shawn is such a friend, and such an insightful witness. The world is better for his influence in it. And, I am grateful to have him as a patient and enduring friend.</p>

			<h3>Sara K.</h3>
			<p>Literary, might be the single word which most people I know might use to describe the people I know — maybe. My friends, I believe, are literary. I go to the deep well of the classics to find the most apt methods for living the best life. And, while some might say that makes me literary, others also sensibly observe that it makes me terribly pedantic and often frustrating. I’m trying, though. And, when I try, I am trying to be more like Sara.</p>

			<p>Sara is the first person whom I’ve met outside of art school that genuinely loves Shakespear. And, I could never tell if all those thespians held genuine love or simple indoctrination. But, Sara loves Shakespear. Sara plays with Shakespear. While I am wrestling with Plato in a cave, struggling to get every ounce of understanding out of a text, Sara is playing lilting word games with Neil Gaiman and Ray Bradbury — letting the brilliance do its work in her. No effort required.</p>

			<p>On my best day, I have been able to grow through serendipity. Those are the days in which I remember to be like Sara.</p>
